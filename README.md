# drawitorloseit
This is a software design document for the web-game Draw It or Lose It for the company The Gaming Room. I think I did well on understanding the design constraints and how to approach each situtation. I liked having the UML class diagram in the design document. I find them helpful since I can understand things better when I see them. I would probably redo and improve the evaluation section. I would do more research to understand Mac, Linux, and Windows. Then I would add more detail to each section. By putting myself into the shoes of the user and think of situations that they would run into. After that, I was able to avoid those situations or ways to improve it. That way the users can have a great experience which is important because they pay the bills. In the future, I look at more examples of software design documents and do more research on the best techniques to approach different situations. I would ask seek advice from more experienced developers to help me improve the software application.
